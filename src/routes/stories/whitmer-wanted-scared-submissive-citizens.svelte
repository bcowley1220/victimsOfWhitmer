<h1 class="pageTitle">Governor Whitmer wanted Citizens Scared and Submissive
</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        There was a common theme in Governor Whitmer’s messages during the 2020 shut down: she wanted people to be healthy and safe. But I am proof that she wanted no such thing.  I am a proud business owner and coach. I care deeply for my clients and customers. I take their livelihoods and safety personally.
    </p>

        When COVID19 first came on the scene, it made sense — for a short time — to encourage the community to be very cautious with an unknown virus. Yet it did not take long for me to see right through the guise the Governor was offering. As though she knew better than every responsible citizen, she required all livelihoods go on lockdown, which involved people barricading themselves away in closed rooms, and embracing sedentary lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Health, hygiene, and taking care of one’s self is my profession. I know how to be healthy and how to be cautious. Bluntly, NO ONE, especially children, should be engaging in athletics with a breathing restriction apparatus on their face. To lok us all away does more harm than benefit.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>My Hand Mixed Ice Cream business came to a screeching halt due to restrictions.</li>
        <li>As a result of gyms closing, my personal training business and fitness classes stopped.</li>
        <li>As a result of ice rinks being closed, my figure skating coaching was also gone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Governor Whitmer has repeatedly conveyed to me as a business owner and a citizen, she doesn’t trust me. But…
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I’ve been a coach for over 30 years.</li>
        <li>I’ve been a personal training and fitness instructor for 15 years.</li>
        <li>I’ve had my own ice cream business for 4 years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I care about my customers and clients more than any government official ever would, and I don’t need a career politician to put themselves in the middle of that relationship.  If Governor Whitmer truly cared about our well-being, she would have recognized that we as citizens are wise and responsible individuals and do not need her micromanagement. Besides, if she wanted to help us, what about encouraging people to eat healthy, be active, get outdoors and breathe in fresh air?
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, encouraging a sedentary lifestyle, take-out foods, and now gambling apps, promotes dependence on the government for money, and a general populace having poor health.  Governor Whitmer could have done better at helping our state be healthy and safe.
