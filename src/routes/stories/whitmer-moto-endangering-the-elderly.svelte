        My 80-year-old mother was wheelchair-bound from a stroke years ago when she had a seizure in May of 2020. That’s a hard health challenge at any time, but Governor Whitmer’s numerous shutdowns made it indescribably harder.  The medical professionals wanted to send her to a rehabilitation nursing center after a short stay at the hospital so that she could fully recover. I appreciate their intentions. But I was keenly aware that nursing homes had become dumping grounds for COVID patients, due to Governor Whitmer’s “brilliant” strategy.

    <p>
        After a long desperate search to send her somewhere that did not accept COVID patients, I found one place that said that they did not take them. I was so relieved to find a place for her to safely recover, or so I thought.  The same day that she was to be transferred, I had a sneaking suspicion that I was being misled. I decided to call the facility once more and requested to speak with the nurse supervisor.  I asked, again, if they had any COVID patients at the time. I expressed my concern about my elderly mother not being exposed under any circumstances.

        The admissions director informed me, per new state orders all facilities like theirs were being forced to start accepting COVID patients. Why? Because the Governor said that they needed to be able to spread patients out so as to avoid overcrowding in the hospitals.  I was shocked and disgusted, but not surprised. For weeks now, Governor Whitmer had been executing this misguided policy of putting COVID-infected patients among our most vulnerable seniors. She knew of the wave of deaths that followed her decision to send COVID patients to nursing homes where it spread among the elderly like wildfire. Yet not only did she continue to allow it — she kept forcing others to comply.

        Keep in mind, gigantic “field hospitals” set up by the Army Corp of Engineers were being shut down without ever serving a single patient. Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent to create these facilities for the express purpose of providing care to COVID patients. But inexplicably Governor Whitmer thought nursing homes — underequipped, and with untrained staff — were a better destination.  I decided it was in the best interest of my mother for me to take a leave of absence from work and care for her myself, which was no easy task. The extra responsibility, the exhaustion, and the loss of income was the least of my worries. Unlike Michigan’s Governor, my mother’s wellbeing and health came first and foremost. It is a choice I will never regret.

        Governor Gretchen Whitmer made a disastrous mistake with her nursing home policy — and she never backed away from it. She demonstrated she cares little about the elderly of our state. Without a doubt, she will go down in history as the worst Governor in our lifetime.
